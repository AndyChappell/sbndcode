# GENIE+Cosmics Event Generation

There are several fhicl configurations for producing GENIE events. The are divided in several sub-directories `flux_config*/`, depending on the type of flux files that are used as input. The flux configurations are described here: https://sbnsoftware.github.io/sbndcode_wiki/The_SBND_flux_files.html.
The directory `default/` contains "links" to the most recent (and hopefully most accurate) fhicl configurations.

If you are uncertain, use the fhicl files in the `default/` directory.
